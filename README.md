> I am in the progress of migrating to **[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nathandaven)** for public repositories and my self-hosted **[Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)** instance for private repositories. I'm sure I'll still use GitHub for some things, but looking to minimize my use of the platform. Thanks for stopping by!
